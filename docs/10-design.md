# Design

To store designed UI wireframes, we are using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

To get access to ReportPortal workspace, please contact our UX Design Team Leader.
Also you can discuss all design-related questions with him.

We already have stable style guide, which includes colors palette, fonts, common elements and ect.
Strongly required to follow it! Color and font variables you can find in `/src/common/css/` folder.

> It's not allowed to use colors and fonts not defined in style guide!

Due to the fact that application is large, there are lot wireframes and ReportPortal permanently developing and changes,
sometimes it's can be very hard to keep all wireframes in Figma up-to-date.
So, above reasons cause the fact, that we have two sources of knowledge at single moment:

- Figma wireframes
- Existing and running application.

So, it's really necessary to be sure that there are no differences between task requirements,
wireframe and app version.
If you have some misunderstanding related to design or you see such differences -
it's a strong reason to contact UX Designer and resolve all issues, before implementation process will be started.

> We are open for suggestions, which are helpful us to improve ReportPortal design.
